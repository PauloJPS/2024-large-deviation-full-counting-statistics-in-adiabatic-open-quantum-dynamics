Codes for reproducing the data and plots of the draft entitled "Large deviation full counting statistics in adiabatic open quantum dynamics"

Authors: Paulo J. Paulino, Igor Lesanovsky, and Federico Carollo

Basic information about the directories 
- The codes are organized in jupyter notebooks, written in python 
- Each notebook is complete, meaning that each notebook gets one part of the data
- The Folder "figures" has a .svg file where the figures where postprocessed (adjust fontsize, fontstyle, lagend size, etc.)
